# Hangman on Terminal!💥
### A game you can play on you Terminal with you friends!😆

---

## 🤔But bruh... how do we connect our terminals?
### **Don't worry, I got you!😆**
All you have to do is follow these simple steps and you will be able to play in no time!

---

### 🔧 1. **Install tmate on both of your terminals**  

#### For Arch/Manjaro
```bash
sudo pacman -S tmate
```
#### For Ubuntu/Debian/Mint
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tmate
```
#### For Termux
```bash
pkg install tmate
```

### 🌐2. Start tmate and copy the ssh session(on host terminal):
```bash
tmate
```
The ssh session will something be like:
```bash
ssh 6zcFpEFp2ZnzcZXDHXvXrVcpQ@sgp1.tmate.io
```

### 📤3. Now just paste the ssh session on the other device:
```bash
ssh 6zcFpEFp2ZnzcZXDHXvXrVcpQ@sgp1.tmate.io
```
*(Don't forget to download tmate on the other device as well)*

## 🥳Boom! You are now connected to the same terminal!
Now just run the hangman file and have fun
